/*
 * [RECOMMENDED] Oper Access Config
 *
 * This section is used to set up staff access to restricted oper only commands.
 * You may define groups of commands and privileges, as well as who may use them.
 *
 * This block is recommended, as without it you will be unable to access most oper commands.
 * It replaces the old ServicesRoot directive amongst others.
 *
 * The command names below are defaults and are configured in the *serv.conf's. If you configure
 * additional commands with permissions, such as commands from third party modules, the permissions
 * must be included in the opertype block before the command can be used.
 *
 * Available privileges:
 *  botserv/administration        - Can view and assign private BotServ bots
 *  botserv/fantasy               - Can use fantasy commands without the FANTASIA privilege
 *  chanserv/administration       - Can modify the settings of any channel (including changing of the owner!)

 *  operserv/config               - Can modify services's configuration
 *  operserv/oper/modify          - Can add and remove operators with at most the same privileges
 *  protected                     - Can not be kicked from channels by Services

 *
 * Firstly, we define 'opertypes' which are named whatever we want ('Network Administrator', etc).
 * These can contain commands for oper-only strings (see above) which grants access to that specific command,
 * and privileges (which grant access to more general permissions for the named area).
 * Wildcard entries are permitted for both, e.g. 'commands = "operserv/*"' for all OperServ commands.
 * You can also negate values with a ~. For example, "~operserv/akill operserv/*" would allow all OperServ
 * commands except for operserv/akill. Note that processing stops at the first matching option, which
 * means "* ~operserv/*" would allow everything because * matches everything.
 *
 * Below are some default example types, but this is by no means exhaustive,
 * and it is recommended that you configure them to your needs.
